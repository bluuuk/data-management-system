# Setup (1-4)

## dgben

We fix the code by removing `#include<malloc.h>` for a successfull compilation. Afterwards, `make` compiles us the `dbgen` executable. Later, we changed the last line by adjusting the `#define PR_END(..)`, but it led to segfaults. Therefore, we stick to `sed`:

```bash
for file in ./*.tbl

do
sed -i '' 's/|$//' $file
done
```

## docker

To not struggle with postgres, we just pull the current `postgres` image and feed it with the table data and the start-up script `schema.sql`.

```bash
cd tpch-dbgen
docker run --name data-mgn-class -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5432:5432 -v $(pwd)/100mb:/etc/data -v $(pwd)/schema.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/schema.sql -d postgres
```


# 5. Run the test queries

We copy the queries from the `tpch-dbgen` repo and comment out invalid characters like `:x`, `:o` and `:n`. However, these queries do not match with the PDF queries.

```bash
for file in ./queries
do
sed -i '' 's/:x/-- :x/' $file
sed -i '' 's/:o/-- :o/' $file
sed -i '' 's/:n/-- :n/' $file
done
```

After copying in the queries, we just wanna check in batch if we copied them correctly.

```bash
make execute-queries-errors 2>&1 | tee error.log 
```

Now we have to correct all the wrong queries and let them run again. 100% of the errors came from the formatting
